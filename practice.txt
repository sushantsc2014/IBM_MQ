*********************
I'm sending message from WorldQueueMgr to Venus 


Venus---
I have local queue Local_Queue_In_Venus created
I created receiver channel WorldQueueMgrToVenus

WorldQueueMgr---
I have Transmission_Queue which is transmission queue
I created sender channel WorldQueueMgrToVenus which is connecting to localhost(1415) (<<IP_address>><<port listening to>>) and Transmission_Queue associated with it.
I also need to create one remote queue Rmote_Queue_in_WolrdQueueMgr which is connecting to local queue Local_Queue_In_Venus in queue manager Venus via transmission queue Transmission_Queue

Please note, receiver and sender channel name should be same.
